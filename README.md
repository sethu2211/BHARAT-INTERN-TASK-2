House Price Prediction

Import the necessary libraries.
The first step is to import the necessary libraries, which are Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

Read the USA_Housing.csv file into a Pandas dataframe.
The second step is to read the USA_Housing.csv file into a Pandas dataframe. This dataframe will contain the data that we will use to train and evaluate the model.

Explore the dataframe by displaying the first few rows, getting some descriptive statistics, and plotting some graphs.
The third step is to explore the dataframe by displaying the first few rows, getting some descriptive statistics, and plotting some graphs. This will help us to understand the data and identify any potential problems.

Select the features that you want to use to predict the house price.
The fourth step is to select the features that you want to use to predict the house price. In this case, we will select the Avg. Area Income, Avg. Area Number of Rooms, Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms, Area Population, and Avg. Area House Age features.

Split the data into a training set and a test set.
The fifth step is to split the data into a training set and a test set. The training set will be used to train the model, and the test set will be used to evaluate the model.

Train a linear regression model on the training set.
The sixth step is to train a linear regression model on the training set. A linear regression model is a simple model that predicts a continuous variable (in this case, the house price) based on a set of independent variables.

Get the coefficients of the model.
The seventh step is to get the coefficients of the model. The coefficients are the weights that the model assigns to each of the features.

Evaluate the model on the test set.
The eighth step is to evaluate the model on the test set. This will help us to determine how well the model generalizes to new data.

Print the mean absolute error, mean squared error, and root mean squared error.
The ninth step is to print the mean absolute error, mean squared error, and root mean squared error. These metrics measure the accuracy of the model.
